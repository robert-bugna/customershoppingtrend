Excited to share my latest project on LinkedIn! 📊 Just created a PowerBI dashboard using a Customer Shopping Trends dataset from Kaggle, and the insights are fascinating! Here's a sneak peek:

🛒 Total Sales by Category
👥 Total Sales by Age Groups
🔄 Total Sales by Purchase Frequency
🚻 Total Sales by Gender
🔒 Total Sales by Subscription Status
🗺️ US Heatmap by Total Sales

Additionally, I've included a PowerBI matrix showcasing the top 10 selling items by season. 🌷❄️🌞

The most eye-catching finding is that Montana, Idaho, California, Illinois, and Nevada lead the US states in total sales. 🇺🇸 These sales are primarily driven by females aged 51-60, with a buying frequency of bi-weekly and every 3 months.

Analyzing shopping trends is not only insightful but also helps in making data-driven decisions for your business. 📈💼
